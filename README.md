"# twitter-copy" 

### School project

As part of a school project, we had to recreate the Twitter home page.

The project consisted in recreating the page using html and css. I allowed myself to add 2 elements in JavaScript.
The first one is an auto-sized `<textarea>`, and the second is a "Tweeter" button than is only active if the `<textarea>` tag isn't empty.
